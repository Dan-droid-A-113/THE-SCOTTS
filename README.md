## 🧠 Problem

Warehouses lose **money, time, and sanity** due to:
- ⏳ Near-expiry inventory
- 🤝 Manual buyer negotiations
- 🐌 Slow clearance decisions

Perfectly usable goods expire because humans love inefficiency.

---

## 💡 Solution

**Green-Chain** automates the clearance process by:
- 📦 Analyzing inventory & expiry data
- 📍 Matching buyers by location & history
- 🧮 Prioritizing urgent stock
- 🎙️ Enabling real-time decisions via a voice agent

Less waste. Faster clearance. Fewer regrets.
